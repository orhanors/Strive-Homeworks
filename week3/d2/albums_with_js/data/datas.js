        albumInfo: `Exodus is the ninth studio album by Jamaican reggae band Bob Marley and the Wailers, first released in June 1977 through Island Records, following Rastaman Vibration (1976).
        On 3 December 1976, an assassination attempt was made on Bob Marley's life in which his chest was 
        grazed and his arm was struck with a bullet, but he survived.[1] Following the assassination 
        attempt Marley left Jamaica and was exiled to London, where Exodus was recorded.[2]
        Exodus is a reggae album, incorporating elements of blues, soul, British rock and funk. 
        The album's production has been characterized as laid-back with pulsating bass beats and 
        an emphasis on piano, trumpet and guitar. Unlike previous albums from the Wailers, Exodus thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sex. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of sex and keeping faith.
        The album was a success both critically and commercially; it received gold certifications 
        in the US, UK and Canada, and was the album that propelled Marley to international stardom.[1] In 2017, Exodus was remastered and re-released for its 40th anniversary. Exodus has more tracks on Marley’s greatest hits album, Legend—the highest selling reggae album of all time—than any of his other records.[1]`,
