		albumInfo: `Random Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic duo Daft Punk, 
        released on 17 May 2013 by Daft Life and Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to late 1970s 
        and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the 
        album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television 
        advertisements, and a web series. Recording took place at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording 
        Studios and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording 
        Studio in Paris, France.

        Following the minimal production of their previous studio album, Human After All (2005),[1] Daft Punk 
        recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation and limited the use of electronic instruments 
        to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album has been noted by 
        music critics as a disco album, while drawing influence from progressive rock and pop. The album features 
        collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly 
        Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Nathan East, and Pharrell Williams. It is Daft Punk's first album 
        released through Columbia Records.`,

        After Bangalter and Homem-Christo's indie rock band Darlin' disbanded, they began experimenting with drum 
        machines and synthesisers. Their debut studio album Homework was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive 
        reviews, backed by singles "Around the World" and "Da Funk". Their second album, Discovery, had further success, 
        supported by hit singles "One More Time", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". In March 2005, 
        Daft Punk released their third album, Human After All, to mixed reviews, though the singles "Robot Rock" and "Technologic" 
        achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album Alive 2007, 
        which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. They composed the score for the film Tron: Legacy, which was 
        released in 2010 alongside its soundtrack album.`,

Unlike previous albums from the Wailers, Exodus thematically moves away from cryptic story-telling; instead it revolves around themes of change, religious politics, and sex. The album is split into two halves: the first half revolves around religious politics, while the second half is focused on themes of sex and keeping faith.
    The album was a success both critically and commercially; it received gold certifications in the US, UK and Canada, and was the album that propelled Marley to international stardom.[1] In 2017, Exodus was remastered and re-released for its 40th anniversary. Exodus has more tracks on Marley’s greatest hits album, Legend—the highest selling reggae album of all time—than any of his other records.[1]`,
